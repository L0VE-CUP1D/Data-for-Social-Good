## Description 
In this project our goal was to create 1D arrays to store data from text files which was data for diseases that corresponds with our user story. We then use a parameterized constructor to get put the data of the text files to be called by the instance variablues we first declared. Then we traverse that data so that we can print it out in the console one at a time with its corresponding parts incrementing while doing so, so that each piece of the data is called.
